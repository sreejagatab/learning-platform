# Learning Platform Features

This document provides an overview of the key features implemented in the learning platform.

## Gamification Elements

The gamification system is designed to increase user engagement and motivation through rewards and progress tracking.

### Points System

- Users earn points for various learning activities
- Points contribute to level progression
- Point history is tracked for transparency

### Badges and Achievements

- Users earn badges for reaching specific milestones
- Badges are categorized by type (learning, engagement, achievement, special)
- Badge levels indicate the difficulty of earning them

### Streaks and Daily Goals

- Daily learning streaks encourage consistent usage
- Streak counters with visual indicators for streak length
- Customizable daily learning goals
- Progress tracking toward daily goals

### Leaderboard

- Competitive element showing top users by points
- Displays user level, streak, and badges
- Highlights the current user's position
